# Simple Chat Application
A basic Python application to simulate a chat system, created by [Sid.py] on April 2025.

## Purpose
This Chat App allows users to send, delete, and view chat messages, serving as a learning project to practice Python list operations, user input handling, and basic error management.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BscCanCode/chat-app.git`  
   *(Replace with your actual repo URL if different, e.g., `todolist` if reusing.)*
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd chat-app`
3. Run the script: `python chat_app.py`  
   *(Rename `todolist.py` to `chat_app.py` if using a new file.)*

## Features
- **Send Message**: Input a new message to the chat list.
- **Delete Message**: Remove the last sent message (with empty check).
- **View Last Message**: Display the most recently entered message.
- **Show All Messages**: Display all current messages in the chat.
- **Exit**: Safely end the application.

## Usage Example
1. Run `python chat_app.py`.
2. Choose `1` to send “Hello friend!” (e.g., [“Hello friend!”] shown).
3. Choose `4` to show all messages (e.g., [“Hello friend!”]).
4. Choose `1` to send “How are you?” (e.g., [“Hello friend!”, “How are you?”] shown).
5. Choose `2` to delete the last message (e.g., [“Hello friend!”] shown).
6. Choose `3` to view the last message entered (e.g., “How are you?”).
7. Choose `5` to exit.

## Development Note
- Uses basic Python (while loops, lists, `try-except` for error handling).
- Future plans: Add multi-user support, message persistence.

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know it has some erros,but it runs too,the reason i kept it as it is: because i want to show people what i understood and develop a code according to my understanding,as my logic and understanding will develop i may or may nor update the code.

## Fun_Fact
- I know what .md means in Readme.md: It means MarkDown.
